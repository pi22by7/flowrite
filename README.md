## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Generating Screenshots

This project includes automated screenshot generation for documentation and app store submissions.

#### Quick Start

```sh
# Generate screenshots automatically
./scripts/generate_screenshots.sh
```

#### Manual Process

1. **Ensure you have a device or emulator running:**

   ```sh
   flutter devices
   ```

2. **Get dependencies:**

   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the integration test:**
   ```sh
   flutter test integration_test/app_test.dart
   ```

Screenshots will be saved in `assets/screenshots/` and organized by platform (android/ios).

üìñ **For detailed screenshot generation documentation, see [docs/SCREENSHOTS.md](docs/SCREENSHOTS.md)**

#### Creating Placeholders

If you want to create placeholder screenshots for immediate use:

```sh
./scripts/create_placeholders.sh
```

#### Continuous Integration

Screenshots are automatically generated via GitHub Actions when:

- Code is pushed to main branch
- PRs are created that modify UI code
- Manually triggered via workflow dispatch

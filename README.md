**Current Version: v2.0.0** | **Flutter: 3.32.6**

Flowrite is a modern, intuitive songwriting and poetry app designed to help creators capture their inspiration anywhere, anytime. With seamless cloud sync, a clean interface, and robust offline support, your creative process has never been more fluid.

But Flowrite is more than just another app—it's a statement about how creative tools should be built and shared.

## 💖 Why Open Source Matters for Creative Tools

When I started learning app development, it wasn't for the sake of coding itself—I wanted to build tools that could help my own creative process. The very first app I envisioned was a simple, beautiful space for songwriting and poetry. But as I searched for resources to learn from, I discovered something troubling: there were virtually no open-source songwriting apps to study, contribute to, or build upon.

This lack of accessible resources hampered my learning journey. I had to take detours, building other projects first to gain the skills I needed. But the dream of creating a truly accessible songwriting app never faded.

Now, with the experience I've gained, I've returned to that original vision. Flowrite embodies a core belief: **the process of creating art should never be paywalled, interrupted by ads, or locked behind proprietary walls.**

Imagine being in the middle of writing a song—that moment when the perfect line finally comes to you—only to be interrupted by a full-screen advertisement. Or discovering that the app you've been using to store your most personal creative work has been discontinued, taking your lyrics with it.

Creative tools should be:

- **Accessible to everyone**, regardless of economic status
- **Transparent** in how they handle your precious creative work
- **Sustainable** through community contribution rather than extractive business models
- **Educational** so the next generation of developers can learn and build upon them

This project is my contribution to that ideal—a foundation that others can learn from, improve upon, and adapt for their own creative needs.

   git clone https://github.com/pi22by7/flowrite.git
   cd flowrite
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your Supabase credentials and Google OAuth client IDs
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

#### Installation & Development

1.  Clone the repository
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/pi22by7/flowrite.git

## 🛠️ Development

This project includes robust scripts and workflows to streamline development, from generating screenshots to running tests.

### Generating Screenshots

This project includes automated screenshot generation for documentation and app store submissions.

#### Quick Start

```sh
# Generate screenshots automatically
./scripts/generate_screenshots.sh
```

#### Manual Process

1. **Ensure you have a device or emulator running:**

   ```sh
   flutter devices
   ```

2. **Get dependencies:**

   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the integration test:**
   ```sh
   flutter test integration_test/app_test.dart
   ```

Screenshots will be saved in `assets/screenshots/` and organized by platform (android/ios).

📖 **For detailed screenshot generation documentation, see [docs/SCREENSHOTS.md](docs/SCREENSHOTS.md)**

#### Creating Placeholders

If you want to create placeholder screenshots for immediate use:

```sh
./scripts/create_placeholders.sh
```

#### Continuous Integration

Screenshots are automatically generated via GitHub Actions when:

- Code is pushed to main branch
